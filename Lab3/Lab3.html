  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    Cluster counting, the method of assigning each cluster of percolated
    sites a group number, provides a visual representation of the
    percolation of a lattice and an intuitive way to check the
    percolation of the lattice (whether a path exists across it).
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The algorithm implemented makes use of two grids to count the
    clusters. The first is an ordinary grid percolated with $p$ fraction
    of the sites set to true. The second grid contains the cluster
    number of each site. Non-percolated sites have a cluster number of
    zero. All other sites are given cluster numbers of integers greater
    than zero. The cluster numbers in this algorithm increment down the
    columns, simply because of the order of the recursive calls. To
    determine the cluster number of each site, the grid is transversed
    until a percolated site is found. Then, a recursive function checks
    all the neighboring sites that are also percolated and assigns the
    current cluster number to each site before incrementing it for the
    next cluster. The sites are turned off on the first grid to ensure
    that the recursive calls do not create an infinite loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the first grid has been searched completely, the method for
    determining the percolation of the lattice merely consists of
    creating the a set (defined as the collection of items without
    repeat) of all the cluster numbers of the first row, and searching
    to see if any cluster numbers of the last row also belong to the
    set. For the visual interface, the information in the cluster number
    grid is outputted to the screen. For small lattices, the cluster
    numbers are outputted in a table in text format. For large lattices,
    each cluster is assigned a random color and outputted to the screen.
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The program allows for the state of the grid, the number of
    clusters, and the existence of a path to be outputted. If a path
    exists, the first cluster number on which a path exists can be
    determined. Sample grids are attached. The number of clusters for a
    given $p$ value has surprisingly low variance. By choosing different
    $p$ values, it can be seen that the aggregation patterns change and
    suggest a critical threshold for the percolation of a lattice and
    the existence of a percolation threshold $p_c$.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Cluster counting is a method that allows the percolation of lattices
    to be analyzed, suggesting visual schemes of presentation and
    providing intuitive methods to obtain desirable information, like
    whether a path exists or not.
