<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>
  For a random walk, there exists an empirical correlation between the
  number of steps traveled and the distance from the origin.
</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
  To program the NSARW, all that was needed were two arrays to store the
  list of positions traveled and two primitive integers to store the
  current location of the NSARW.  For the SARW, a much more involved
  algorithm was required.  Two arrays to store the list of positions, a
  grid measuring N by N (where N is the number of steps going to be
  taken by the program) and a more advanced traveling algorithm were
  required.  The backbone of the algorithm was taken from the NSARW, but
  to fulfill the requirements that the path not intersect itself, a
  backtrack method was implemented.  If a SARW gets stuck, the backtrack
  method will bring the walker back some number of time steps (depending
  on its progress in the simulation) and resume the random walk.  The
  functions are mutually recursive, ending only once the number of steps
  has been met.  Both random walkers should have a plot function, and
  the main tester program has a linear regression function to analyze
  the goodness of fit to a line of the log-log plot of the distance vs.
  number of steps graph.  The program rejects any fit with
  ($r^2$ < 0.95) and shows the first fit that has ($r^2$ > 0.95).
  The slope of the log-log plot is given in the terminal window.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  After the first coding of the program, the generation of positions
  worked correctly for both the NSARW and the SARW.  The program plotted
  the paths to the screen, though oriented upside-down (as that is how
  the computer stores the positions).  The analysis method was
  implemented, but drawing the distance to time steps graph did not work
  correctly.  It was determined that the program was processing the data
  incorrectly, giving erroneous values for the slope of the log-log
  plot. Various bugs were removed, and the tester code was revamped. Of
  the bugs fixed, one is the correct orientation of plot outputted to
  the screen, the correct sieving of distance-time points (every 10
  rather then every one), and fitting the data to a log-log plot (the
  program was unintentionally fitting the data to a linear plot). After
  correcting these bugs and making the second version, the program works
  as intended.  Sample runs are attached.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  The program allows the nature of random walks (non-self-avoiding and
  self-avoiding) to be experimented with.  The correlation of the
  distance vs. time steps graph was analyzed using a log-log plot. The
  values of the slope returned for the NSAWR and the SAWR were 0.63 and
  0.69, both values roughly plus or minus 0.10. The implication of this
  finding is that those values are the exponents of the relationship
  between time steps and the average distance traveled.
