  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    The Game of Life provides a set of simple rules that allow for
    cellular automaton.
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    My implementation involves storing all of the particles currently on
    in a set, a collection that contains all of its elements in no
    specified order without repetition.  The grid is initialized by
    reading in a collection of seed points.  To advance to the next
    generation, Life specifies three rules involving the number of
    neighbors in all eight directions that are currently on (count):
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A cell will be turned off if it is currently on and the
        count is not 2 or 3.
      </li>
      <li>
        A cell will remain on if it is currently on and the
        count is 2 or 3.
      </li>
      <li>
        A cell will be turned on if it is currently off and
        the count is 3.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    My implementation accomplishes this by creating another set of the
    particles to check, which includes all of the current positions and
    their neighbors.  Then, it iterates over that set and puts the new
    positions in a new set.  The program allows for dynamic viewing of
    the advances of generations.
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The amazingly simple rules of Life indeed do provide for an
    elaborate playing field.  The sample run pictures show a simple
    induction coil progressing through its generations.  Lots of
    structures and pretty pictures can be generated.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In just three rules, Life provides a complete basis for cellular
    automaton.
