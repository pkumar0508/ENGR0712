========

As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, I took a class called
"Introduction to High Performance Computing and Modeling," though the class was basically an
open-ended exploration into the computational implementation of physical and scientific models.

The professor described some physical process, and we were told to model it. She didn't care which language,
but did require that there was pictures to show the model in action. After taking this class,
I was invited to research with her that summer.

Topics modeled:

- [Diffusion Limited Aggregation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation)
- [Percolation Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory)
- [Ising Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model)
- Random Walks ([self-avoiding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk) and [non-self-avoiding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk))
- [Metropolis Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)
for modeling phase separation of oil, water and soap
- [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Implementations are given in Java 4 (predominant Java version at the time).
The Java applet versions seem to be broken currently, but expect those to be fixed in the near future.
