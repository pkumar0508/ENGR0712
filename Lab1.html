<h1>Finding the Percolation Constant for Site Percolation</h1>
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>
For a square lattice, there is a percolation threshold $P_c$ so that a
path is likely to be made from one side of the lattice to the other.
</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
To use a computer simulation of a lattice, represented by an array of
Boolean variables, to simulate percolation.  First, the array would be
populated by $p$ fraction of the total elements in the array.  This is
done by finding the number of elements to be placed, and then setting
that number of elements at random array positions to true.  Varying $p$
will make it possible to find the percolation threshold.  The main
routine will begin at some initial $p_0$ value, and increment $p$ by
some $\delta$ until the lattice is percolated.  That $p$ will be
reported as $P_c$.  Given a lattice state, it is tested for percolation
by starting at the left most column and recursively transversing the
array over the positive values.  If the transversal reaches the last
column, then the lattice has been percolated.  If the transversal
begins at every row in the first column and cannot reach the last
column, then the lattice has not been percolated.  Refer to the
attached code for the exact implementation.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
After adjusting the initial $p_0$ value and the $\delta$ value to
optimize running time to 0.6 and 0.005, multiple runs determine the
value of $P_c$ to be $0.615 \pm 0.01$.  Precision was only desired to
two significant digits. More could have been obtained by adjusting
$\delta$.  From this result, it is seen that a considerable percentage
more than half (p = 0.5) is needed to percolate the lattice. Refer to
the attached screen dump for two examples of runtime output. The
lattice was not outputted because of its enormous size ($N$ = 200).
Discrepancies between the $P_c$ value returned and the real value
(inaccuracy) may have resulted from an imperfect lattice populating
method or too small an N value.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The simulation was able to find a value for $P_c$, confirming the
hypothesis of the existence of such a value. The program as written may
return an inaccurate $P_c$ value because of the populating method and
the $N$ value chosen. Also, the method for finding the cutoff is rather
crude; there is no statistical analysis for the likelihood that the
$P_c$ value returned is close to the actual value. For more precision,
$N$ and $\delta$ should be varied.  For more accuracy, a method to
evaluate the generated value should be implemented to test if it is
within statistical bounds.
