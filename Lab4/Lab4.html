  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    For the creation of a collection of particles by diffusion limited
    aggregation, the resulting arrangement is a fractal.
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    First, a lattice is created to hold all of the particles to be
    aggregated.  A center particle is placed to initiate the
    aggregation. Then, particles are introduced at the edges of the grid
    and find their way to the center particle by means of a
    non-self-avoiding random walk. Once particles find the center
    particles or particles that have been attached to connecting
    particles, the walk of that particle ends and a new particles is
    introduced to make another random walk.  Once that was coded, the
    extra feature of the existence of some probability $p$ such that
    when a particle finds a branch, it will test whether or not it will
    stop or keep random walking, where $p$ is the probability it stops
    and $1-p$ is the probability that it keeps walking.  After that
    was implemented, the option of having specific colored particles was
    introduced.  With this playing rule, particles may only stop once
    they find a compatible neighbor, a neighbor that shares the same
    color as it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first version of the program was implemented with an array of
    Particles.  The second version was implemented with a Hashtable of
    Positions mapping to Particles.  Thus, memory requirements for the
    second implementation are independent of size and vary only with the
    number of particles requested.  Additional features were added to
    the second version.
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The results of the computer simulation show that the arrangement
    formed is some sort of self-repeating structure, suggesting that it
    is a fractal.  As the probability $p$ is reduced, the arrangement
    collapses toward the center, and the resulting structure has a lower
    average radius.  When colored particles were introduced, the two
    colors grew along each other.  When the red particles were added in
    greater number than the green, results suggest that it is not
    possible to enclose the green particle seed (failed to enclose the
    green seed at a ratio of 999:1).  Consult the attached pictures.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Through multiple runs, it became very clear that diffusion limited
    aggregation of particles led to the formation of a fractal.
    Different rules for different environments led to different
    formations, but each one was fundamentally fractal-like.
