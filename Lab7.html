  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    The Metropolis Algorithm as implemented in the oil and water case
    can be modified to include a third surfactant particle in phase
    separation simulations.  Temperature varies in simulations and the
    phenomena of simulated annealing can be observed.
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of two particles as in the last lab, there are three now:
    oil, soap, water.  All of the same rules apply.  When the algorithm
    is called, it scans through the grid, picking another point at
    random and checking whether swapping the two will result in a more
    favorable state.  If so, the swap is performed.  If not, a
    probability is generated using the Boltzmann distribution.  Allowing
    $\Delta E$ to be the change in energy and another parameter $\beta$
    to relate to the temperature such that $\beta = 1/(kT)$, the formula
    to calculate the relative probability is $P(S) = e^{-\beta\Delta
    E}$. The $\beta$ parameter increases with every time step, implying
    that temperature decreases. This is the implementation of simulated
    annealing. In terms of $\Delta E$, relative energies are assigned to
    each of the neighbors. The oil next to water is very unfavorable
    ($+2$), but next to each other is favorable ($-2$). The soap tends
    to stick to other soap ($-1$). Instead of oil and water being
    neighbors, a more favored state is being next to soap (0). Program
    allows dynamic viewing of the grid.
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The grid size dimensions were made 30 by 30.  Letting $N = 1000$ in
    the two particle case, trials consistently phase separated, so that
    was what that parameter was set to be.  Refer to the attached trial
    run screenshots for metropolis algorithm with surfactant.  It was
    found that when the temperature was considerable low, there was
    still substantial movement by the particles, as opposed to the two
    particle case where the particles separated out and did nothing
    more.  It implies that when soap is introduced, the equilibrium
    reached (in my simulations) was a dynamic neutral equilibrium, that
    multiple states had the lowest energies, and there were enough
    degrees of freedom for the grid to switch between the states.  The
    soap tends to coat the surfaces of the oil and water droplets.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Using computer simulations, phase separation was able to be modeled
    when accounting for a surfactant.  By varying temperature, simulated
    annealing was achieved and could be seen in the visual output to
    contribute to the complete phase separation of the oil and water
    particles.
